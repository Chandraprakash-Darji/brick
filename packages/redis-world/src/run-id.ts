 * starting the same run twice creates one run: the second start finds it already
 * there.
 *
 * The id is a real ULID. Its time is `runKeyTime`, not the clock, because the SDK
 * seeds a workflow's clock from the time in its run id. Pass the time the run is
 * for, such as when the event it handles happened, and the same time on every
 * attempt.
 *
 * @param options - The options given to `start()`. `runKey` is a non-empty string
 * that names the run (at most 1024 characters), and `runKeyTime` is milliseconds
 * since the epoch.
 * @returns The id without its `wrun_` prefix, which the SDK adds.
 * @throws When `runKey` is not a usable string, or comes without a valid `runKeyTime`.
