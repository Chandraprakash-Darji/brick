# Brick-TS

Brick-TS is a TypeScript backend framework on Bun. You define services with validated actions, mount them with `brick()`, and get an Elysia HTTP server with OpenAPI output and a typed client.

The framework runs on Bun, Elysia, TypeBox, and Drizzle ORM. The pages example adds Better Auth and Postgres.

## Install

You need Bun 1.2 or later.

```sh
bun add @brickkit/core @brickkit/cli @brickkit/crud
```

## Build a minimal API

Define a service, mount it, and start the server.

```ts
import { brick, defineAction, defineService } from "@brickkit/core";

const healthService = defineService("system");
const ping = defineAction({
  name: "ping",
  execute: async () => ({ status: "ok" }),
});
healthService.action(ping);

const app = brick({ services: [healthService] });
app.listen(4000);
```

This serves `POST /api/system/ping`.

Inspect the same app without starting it:

```sh
brick gen openapi src/app.ts --output openapi.json
brick info src/app.ts
```

The entry module must default-export the `BrickApp` and must not call `.listen()` inside it. Keep the listener in a separate bootstrap file. The CLI reference is in `packages/cli/README.md`.

## Packages

| Package                  | Directory                | What it holds                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@brickkit/core`         | `packages/core/`         | Services, actions, the `brick()` server, events and workflow listeners, and the typed client at `@brickkit/core/client`.     |
| `@brickkit/crud`         | `packages/crud/`         | Opt-in CRUD plugin with field policies, filtering, and hooks.                                                                |
| `@brickkit/cli`          | `packages/cli/`          | The `brick` binary: `dev`, `start`, `build`, `worker`, `gen`, and `info`, plus the Vite client plugin and the dev dashboard. |
| `@brickkit/redis-world`  | `packages/redis-world/`  | A Redis world for the Workflow SDK, which runs workflow listeners durably.                                                   |
| `@brickkit/bullmq-world` | `packages/bullmq-world/` | A Redis and BullMQ world for the Workflow SDK, the same interface as the Redis world.                                        |

The dev dashboard's Workflows tab is the Workflow SDK's inspector. Its source is in `packages/workflow-inspector/`, which is not published: the CLI build copies it into `@brickkit/cli`.

The events and workflows example is in `examples/events/`. The full app is in `examples/pages/`. It mounts the API in process with TanStack Start and uses workspace packages directly. The docs site is in `www/`, with content in `www/content/docs`.

## Develop and test

```sh
bun install
bun test packages
bun run pages:dev
```

`bun test packages` runs the framework tests without Postgres. `bun run pages:dev` builds the framework and starts the combined web and API server on port 5174. Rerun it after you change framework code.

The pages suite needs Postgres. It is documented in `examples/pages/README.md`.

```sh
bun run pages:typecheck
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/drafton_test bun run pages:test
```

Run the full gate before you push:

```sh
bun run check
```

`bun run check` runs lint, format check, build, typecheck, and tests. The worlds' own tests need Redis and run separately with `bun run test:worlds` (point `REDIS_TEST_URL` at a server, or let it start a container). Each package also has `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, and `format:check`. Shared config lives in `.oxlintrc.json` and `.oxfmtrc.json`.

## Release

Releases run from a clean, up-to-date `main` checkout:

```sh
bun run release patch
```

The GitHub `publish-npm.yml` workflow stages candidate versions without changing Git refs. Its `validate` matrix builds, typechecks, tests, and packs `core`, `crud`, `cli`, `redis-world`, and `bullmq-world` separately. Only when all five validations pass does it publish each validated tarball. After all five npm publishes succeed, it commits and tags the version, then creates the GitHub release. A failed validation or publish does not create a release commit. No builds or tests run again inside the individual publish jobs, so a later test failure cannot leave only some packages published.

Set `dry_run` to validate and pack the next version without creating a commit, tag, or npm release. Beta releases run from `beta`. If npm itself fails after some uploads, rerun the failed jobs for that same candidate; already-published package versions are skipped.

The local `scripts/release.ts` command dispatches this same workflow, so it also waits for publication before creating a release commit. `--dry-run` previews the next version locally. The internal `--prepare` mode changes only package manifests and the lockfile for workflow validation.
